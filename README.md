# Bachelor's thesis

This repository includes the source code for a data processing and visualization tool for GENE simulations. This project is written in *Python* and it uses packages such as **NumPy** and **SciPy** for scientific computing. **Matplotlib** is used to produce data visualizations.

This code is part of my bachelor's thesis and research conducted for *Aalto University Department of Applied Physics*. The [thesis](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/items/03857fd2-c96c-4bc2-9196-3af071f48fc9) is openly available at the *Harald Herlin Learning Center*.
